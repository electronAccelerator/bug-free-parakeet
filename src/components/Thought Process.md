Saving the items that the user deleted- technically is following the requirements, and is the additional feature of allowing the user to recover any accidental removal of to do items. Should implement a limit on the items saved that the user deletes.

Implemented tags through a string input, with the seperate tags being seperated by commas.
The tag filters use regex to filter through the string inputs and return the proper todo items that fit the tag.
